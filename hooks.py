"""
hooks.py - Threshold-based shell notification hooks for claude-usage.

Create ~/.claude/usage_hooks.json to configure.  Example:

    {
      "daily_cost_usd": {
        "warn":        1.00,
        "critical":    5.00,
        "on_warn":     "notify-send 'Claude Usage' 'Daily cost passed $1'",
        "on_critical": "notify-send 'Claude Usage' 'Daily cost passed $5'"
      },
      "daily_tokens": {
        "warn":    500000,
        "on_warn": "echo 'Claude: 500K tokens used today'"
      }
    }

Supported metrics (evaluated once per scanner run):
  daily_cost_usd   Estimated API cost today (USD)
  daily_tokens     Total input + output tokens today
  daily_turns      Number of assistant turns today

Each metric block may define:
  warn / critical      Numeric threshold value
  on_warn / on_critical  Shell command executed when threshold is crossed

Commands are fired once per threshold crossing per day.  A threshold resets
(allowing the command to fire again) once usage drops back below 90 % of it.
